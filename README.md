# Iris Flowers Machine Learning Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains my solution for the "Iris Flowers Machine Learning Assignment," which is part of the **ENSF  619 - Special Topics** course. The assignment focuses on refreshing fundamental machine learning coding skills by working with the classic Iris Flowers dataset. It covers data preparation, exploration, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and optional hyperparameter tuning.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `code/`: Contains Python code for the assignment.
  - `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook files (e.g., `assignment_1.ipynb`)
- `data/`: Stores the Iris dataset CSV file (e.g., `iris_dataset.csv`).
- `results/`: Reserved for output files or results generated during analysis.
- `environment/`: Includes a `requirements.txt` file listing required Python packages.
- `images/`: (Optional) Images or plots generated in the analysis.
- `models/`: (Optional) Directory for storing trained machine learning models.

## Getting Started

To run the assignment code, follow these steps:

1. Set up your Python development environment with the required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Navigate to the `code/` directory.
4. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `assignment_1.ipynb` or execute the Python script `assignment_1.py`.

Make sure to meet the assignment's requirements and follow the instructions in the assignment description.
